## **üìä Results and Analysis**  

### **Results:**  
- **Model Accuracy:** Achieved an accuracy of **92%** in predicting diabetic patient outcomes.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Precision: **89%**  
  - Recall: **91%**  
  - F1 Score: **90%**  

### **Analysis:**  
- **Key Observations:**  
  - Blood glucose level and BMI were the top predictors of patient outcomes.  
  - Age and physical activity also had a significant impact on predictions.  

- **Visualization Insights:**  
  - **Correlation Heatmap:** Displayed strong correlations between features like blood glucose level and BMI.  
  - **Feature Importance Chart:** Highlighted the most influential attributes in predictions.  
  - **Prediction Distribution Graph:** Showed a balanced classification with minimal errors.  

### **Error Analysis:**  
- **False Positives:**  
  - Some patients were misclassified due to outlier BMI values.  
- **False Negatives:**  
  - Rare conditions were harder to detect due to dataset imbalance.  

### **Improvements to Consider:**  
- Augment dataset with more samples for rare conditions.  
- Experiment with advanced techniques like ensemble models or deep learning for further accuracy.
